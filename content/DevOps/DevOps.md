### Manufacturing as a Model for IT
#### Consolidated Aircraft B-24 Liberator

* Incredibly sophisticated. ~500k parts, assembled by unskilled labor. 
* No Mfg process. Parts were cast in rubber molds, so every part was slightly different.
* Assembled in the heat of San Diego, which warped the metal and required whole assemblies to be adjusted.
* Charles Sorenson of Ford Motor Co. brought a Manufacturing process â€¦ went from 250 planes a year to 650 planes a month.

### Sorenson's Lessons from the B-24

* Standard Parts
* Standard Process
* Standard Infrastructure
* Build For Change

### Sorenson's Lessons from the B-24

* Standard Parts
* Standard Process

* ***Build For Change***
    * Turn craftwork into commodities
    * Design for improvement, not function

##### The B-24 ended World War II as the most produced heavy bomber in history. At over 18,400 units, half by Ford Motor Company, it still holds the distinction as the most-produced American military aircraft.

### The B-24 is like our current Systems of Record that we build waterfall with our production line developers (often outsourced)

### DevOps in Summary

* DevOps is about bringing the manufacturing line revolution to IT
* Think about the B-24 Bomber, lean production and Toyota
* First and foremost this is all about cultural change
* "DevOps" is really just an unfortunate name

## Now we need some buzzwords
### these are key themes that have influenced my thinking <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

## [Pets vs Cattle] [1]

* Pets are given names like pussinboots.cern.ch <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* The are unique, lovingly hand raised and cared for <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* When they get ill, you nurse them back to health <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Cattle are given numbers like vm0042.cern.ch <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* They are almost identical to other cattle <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* When they get ill, you get another one <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

![Pet](img/pet.png) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> ![Cattle](img/cattle.png) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

Future application architectures should use Cattle but Pets with strong configuration management are viable and still needed <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
