### Lets talk about some **principles** for selecting software
Let's call them Jeremy's golden rules for buying ;-)

1. Software for your enterprise needs to be proven and ready for production <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
2. Everything you run in production should have long term enterprise grade support <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
3. Your cost of acquisition for software should be minimal (license plus training etc.) and the ongoing cost should be predictable <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
4. Your TCO calculations should include the Cost of Exit and should be factored in during the selection process <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
5. Your exposure to Vendor lock-in should be minimised and you should be able to walk away and keep the bits <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
6. You shouldn't pay for upgrades! <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->

### And some bonus rules for Open Source
#### Though you might apply them to proprietary software too <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

1. What is the size and adoption of the community behind this solution? Is it still growing? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
2. How open is the community? Does the license allow the community to fork the code?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

* Some invest in focused areas <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
